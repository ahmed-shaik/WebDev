What is Git?
Free & Open Source Version Control System -> tools that help to tracks changes in code

What is Github?
Website where we host repositories online

git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"

Basic Commands
• Clone - Cloning a repository on our local machine   git clone <- some link ->
• status - displays the state of the code git status
• add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.  git add <- file name ->
• commit - it is the record of change    git commit -m "some message"
• push - upload local repo content to remote repo  git push origin main
• init- used to create a new git repo git init

git remote add origin link
git remote -v (to verify remote)
git branch (to check branch)
git branch -M main (to rename branch)
git push origin main


Branch Commands
git branch  (to check branch)
git branch -M main (to rename branch)
git checkout <- branch name ->   (to navigate) - move from one branch to another
git checkout -b <- new branch name -> (to create new branch)
git branch -d <- branch name -> (to delete branch)

Merging Code
git diff <- branch name->  (to compare commits, branches, files & more)
git merge <- branch name-> (to merge 2 branches)
or
Create a PR(pull request)

Pull Request
It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

git pull origin main
used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo
to match that content.

Merge Conflicts
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code
between two commits.

Fixing Mistakes
Case 1 : staged(add) changes
git reset <- file name ->
git reset

Case 2 : commited changes (for one commit)
git reset HEAD~1

Case 3 : commited changes (for many commits)
git reset <- commit hash ->
git reset --hard <- commit hash ->

What is Forking?
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream"
repository.
Fork is a rough copy.
